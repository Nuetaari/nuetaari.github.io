  Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is a
  Japanese multimedia project centered on a virtual idol group,
  prominently featured in its television anime adaptation with the
  same name and the mobile game Love Live! School Idol Festival:
  ALL STARS. As part of a well-known franchise with an active
  fanbase, from 2017 to 2019, the project conducted monthly
  popularity polls for its nine main characters. This paper presents
  an analysis of the popularity poll results using the eigenvector
  centrality method. The poll results were transformed into a
  weighted, directed graph in an adjacency matrix representation of
  how favorable characters score against one another, presented in
  two variations for the experiment. Compared to a ranking result
  from the Borda Count method, one variation showed a balanced
  score distribution while the other showed a highly skewed score
  distribution. Through this analysis, it is determined that Setsuna
  Yuki, Karin Asaka, and Kasumi Nakasu are the top three fanfavorite characters, respectively.
