  Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play turn-based space
  fantasy RPG (Role-Playing Game) developed and published by
  Hoyoverse on April 26, 2023. Some of the main features of Honkai:
  Star Rail include collecting and upgrading characters and their
  equipment to successfully engage and win in a fight with some
  enemies. To get new characters, players must go through a gacha
  system called Warp that requires an in-game currency called
  Stellar Jades. Similarly, players need some other types of resources
  to upgrade their characters and equipment. One way of obtaining
  said resources is to solve puzzles that are available on many parts
  of the map. One of the available puzzles in Honkai: Star Rail is The
  Navigation Compass Puzzle. This paper investigates the
  mathematical model of variations of the navigation compass puzzle
  using number theory, develops some simple solvability checks, and
  develops a solver program for a variation of the puzzle. The
  findings reveal that certain variations of the puzzle are always
  solvable, while others are unsolvable or not yet determined.
