  <p>
    Good evening. My name is Ghifary, a second-year undergraduate
    student at Institut Teknologi Bandung. I'm broadly interested in systems research,
    particularly in operating systems, database systems, and systems for AI/ML
    with a focus on performance and efficiency.
    My latest notable works include
    <a href="https://github.com/Sanesasaha/OSusumeNanDesuka">OSusumeNanDesuka</a>, an x86 32-protected operating system written in C and
    <a href="https://informatika.stei.itb.ac.id/~rinaldi.munir/Stmik/2024-2025/Makalah2025/Makalah-IF2211-Strategi-Algoritma-2025%20(100).pdf">InpoCache</a>, 
    an exploration on indexed prompt-caching lookup mechanisms for efficient LLM query serving.
    Feel free to reach out via
    <a href="mailto:13523066@std.stei.itb.ac.id">email</a>.
  </p>
